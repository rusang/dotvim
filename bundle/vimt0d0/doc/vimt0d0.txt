*vimt0d0.txt* Syntax highlighting for TODO lists, Orgmode-like

        Vimt0d0 syntax highlighting by Andrea Schiavini ~

Install                                                    |vimt0d0-install|

This syntax highlighting supports three different formats for todo
entries:

[ ] new entry
[...] in progress entry
[X] complete entry

It uses String, Special and Comment syntax definitions, so it works
with almost any colorscheme.

It also supports commenting ( `#` char to the end of line) and highlights the
following words in comments: TODO, FIXME, XXX, NOTE, WTF, and ???.

It automatically works with .t0d0 files. If you want to try it on another
file, choose this syntax with

:set filetype=vimt0d0

Note: I recommend using Tim Pope's pathogen plugin to install this
colorscheme. See https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen . If you've installed
pathogen properly you can install vimt0d0 with the following commands:

        $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
        $ git clone https://github.com/metalelf0/vimt0d0.git
